# mac shock
The aluminum Macbook Pro gives a mild shock when connected to a wall socket and charging. It only happens when I'm, for example, not wearing shoes or slippers and my feet are resting on the ground (i.e. by body is acting as a conductor).

I contacted apple and I was told to perform the following steps:

Shutdown

hold ⇧+ctrl+⌥+power for 10 seconds

wait 30 seconds then hold ⇧+ctrl+⌥+R+power (Let the Mac reboot three times with that apple tone, then let go. The Mac reboots again.)

This did not fix the problem and I was not told what these steps were supposed to do. They have asked me to purchase a three pin version of the adapter and see if that fixes my problem.

My last MacBook Pro was giving pretty severe jolts towards end of life. Hence a bit concerned.
