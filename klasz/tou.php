TOU, in addition to any liquidated damages under clause (d), you agree to pay Klasz fifty ringgit (RM50) for each and every Item you post

violation of the TOU) agrees to pay Klasz an additional fifty ringgit (RM50) for each Item posted by the Posting Agent on behalf of the Principal in violation of the TOU.<br/>

on which you engage in such conduct.<br/>

actual damages can be reasonably calculated. Notwithstanding any other
